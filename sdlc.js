// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = `In this initial phase, project stakeholders, including clients and end-users, collaborate to identify and document the software requirements. This involves understanding the desired functionalities, performance expectations, user interface specifications, and other project-specific criteria.

Once the requirements are gathered, the development team analyzes them to determine the feasibility and complexity of the project.`
const design = `System architects and designers create a detailed blueprint for the software solution, defining the system's structure, data flow, and algorithms. This phase helps lay the foundation for the development process.`
const implementation = `The implementation phase involves the actual coding and development of the software based on the design specifications. Programmers write the code, perform unit testing, and integrate the individual components into a cohesive system. This phase is where the majority of the development work takes place.`
const testingAndIntegration= `Testing is a crucial phase to identify and fix defects or bugs in the software. It involves different levels of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Testers ensure that the software meets the defined requirements, functions correctly, and performs as expected in various scenarios.

Once the software passes all necessary testing, it is ready for deployment. This phase involves packaging and releasing the software to end-users or deploying it to the production environment. It may involve activities such as installation, configuration, data migration, and training to ensure a smooth transition from development to production.`
const maintain = `After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This phase involves monitoring the software's performance, addressing issues or bugs reported by users, and applying updates or enhancements as required. Maintenance aims to keep the software in a usable and reliable state throughout its lifecycle.`
